## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Intelligent Note-Taking:** Captures fleeting ideas and saves them directly to a Notion "Brain Dump" database.
*   **Actionable Task Creation:** Recognizes commands to create new to-do items and automatically sets their status to "To Do".
*   **Smart Reminder Scheduling:** Parses natural language (e.g., "tomorrow at 5pm") to set precise due dates for reminders.
*   **Conversational Fallback:** Identifies general questions and engages in a helpful, AI-powered conversation.
